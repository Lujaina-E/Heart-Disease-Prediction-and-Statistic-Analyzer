# Heart-Disease-Prediction-and-Statistic-Analyzer

##This project takes in statistical data about patients of different ages, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol values,
maximum heart rate, and provides the user with options to analyze the data based on their input and the output chosen by user. 
Visual plots were added at the end to help with behaviour statistics, and a prediction model was added to tell the patient if 
they're likely to get heart disease with the input they've chosen.
